#### Talks

[Active Directory - Detecting Resilient Adversaries](https://github.com/RiccardoAncarani/talks/tree/master/r00tMI)
More than 95 percent of the biggest corporates use Active Directory (AD) to manage identity, enforce policies and control business-critical assets. Despite AD represents the single point of failure in most cases, companies are still struggling with securing it; More than often, after obtaining an initial foothold, the attackers gain the maximum privileges within a short time period and even without being noticed before itâ€™s too late. The aim of this talk is to bring awareness on the techniques that adversaries might employ whilst providing practical advices on how to stop and detect them.

[Attack Detection Workshops - Initial Access](https://github.com/RiccardoAncarani/talks/blob/master/F-Secure/F-Secure-Attack-Detection-Webinars-Initial-Access.pdf)
Presented the first episode of F-Secureâ€™s Attack Detection Workshops (https://www.f-secure.com/en/consulting/events/attack-detection- fundamentals-workshops) that covered: The techniques threat actors use to bypass mail filtering controls and obtain foothold; making use of open-source tools to emulate the initial access vectors of Emotet and those used in Operation Cobalt Kitty; Learning how to detect these attacks using endpoint logs or memory analysis
